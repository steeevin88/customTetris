A parody of my favorite classroom pastime: [Tetris](https://tetris.com)! Except you can create your own pieces...

## How To Play 🕹
- Using the 4x4 containers, click on the individual squares to create custom polyominoes
- If the squares are left blank, the 7 classical tetromino shapes will be used, mirroring a game of classical Tetris
- Click the button below to begin the game

## Keyboard Commands 🎮
- ⬅️➡️ to move the pieces
- ⬆️ to rotate the current piece
- ⬇️ to drop the current piece by one layer
- "C" to hold the current piece
- "Spacebar" to immediately drop the current piece to its ghost image
